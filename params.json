  "body": "### Welcome to my website!.\r\nThis is the first time that I am attempting serious edits on GitHub and I am very excited about it. I hope that I will be able to contribute to my team's progress in a productive and helpful way.\r\n\r\n### My Qualifications\r\nI have been coding for two years now. I started off doing simple projects in Processing, but I got pretty good at that after a while. I learned pure Java and got some experience in JavaScript when me and my good friend John teamed up to make a beta version of Curve Fever. As of right now, I feel comfortable in Java, JavaScript, and Python.\r\n\r\n### What I Am Up to Now\r\nRight now, I am volunteering at the Wireless and Mobile Networking Lab at Columbia University under Dr. Gil Zussman, but more directly for Varun Gupta. I am working directly with and undergrad Andy and a graduate student Bohan. They have both been friendly, but I can tell that they're a little hesitant about having someone on board with so little of the necessary knowledge for the work here. I remain optimistic that I can catch up and be a good contributor until I leave on August 12.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out our [documentation](https://help.github.com/pages) or [contact support](https://github.com/contact) and we’ll help you sort it out.\r\n",
